Brain Tumor Segmentattion is the project  based on categorizing only three kinds of the the brain tumors ie Meningioma,Pituitary and as well as if a person has no tumor.
The project was developed by using Tensorflow and OpenvCv. It uses the VGG3 block convolution neural Network Architecture to train on the images of different types
The model developed an accuracy of 96% on the test set of the data images
